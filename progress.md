# Progress

Upstream base: `de784cee2` (nightly-labs/openbot, 2026-11-03). Remote `upstream`. Branch `personal`.

Plan: `docs/plans/2026-11-03-personal-openbot.md`. Research: `docs/plans/research/`.

## Done
- 2026-11-03: Cloned. Six research reports written and spot-checked against the code. Plan written. No code changed.
- 2026-11-03: Plan revised per Hridya: name Hive (`dev.hridaya.hive`); accounts stay on the mini, nothing to upstream; Dynamic Island dropped from scope; Copilot a first-class provider with a multi-account spike; new Phase 4 fallback chains (Codex#1 → Codex#2 → Copilot, host default chain, failover on start failures); Phase 7 is Android (ntfy on the mini for notifications, build on `win-pc`).

## Next
- Phase 0, Task 0.1 (Bun 1.4.2: this Mac has 1.3.14).

## Evidence
- Spot checks: `AppView.tsx:77`, `listen-loopback.ts:35`, `electron-builder.yml:21-24`, `acp-agent-presets.ts:20`, `server-mode.ts:53`, `ipc-agents.ts:45-47`, `turns.tsx:75`, `provider-runtime.ts:2364-2370`.
- Open conflict: R-tokens says one Codex app-server per agent; the code shares one for default agents. Task 1.1 settles it.

- 2026-11-03: Added Task 1.9 (minimal tool descriptions with a tool-choice eval), Task 6.5 (one agent list across hosts, move agents), Phase 8 (performance hill-climb with a scoreboard and budgets), Phase 9 (WhatsApp through Baileys on the mini). ntfy may run on the mini or the Windows PC.

## Blocked on Hridya
- Copilot browser sign-in (Task 3.1), and a second GitHub login if Task 3.3 runs.
- Second Codex account sign-in (Task 4.1).
- Install the ntfy app on the phone (Task 7.3).
- WhatsApp QR scan, and which number (Task 9.1).

## Answered
- Phone is Android; iOS out of scope. Copilot plan: Pro via GitHub Education. Name: Hive.
